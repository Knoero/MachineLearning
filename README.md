# Machine Learning Notes
- Personal study notes 
- Collect the concepts, algorithms and models in machine learning and deep learning
- Try to build a systematic knowledge ranging from basic mathematics to application of common models
- Serve as a knowledge base and a code base for future study

# Reference materials: 
The study notes are taken from multiple sources, including course notes in Purdue and two famous free books introducing deep learning
