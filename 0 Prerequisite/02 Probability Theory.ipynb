    "# Basic concepts\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Definition: \n",
    "- Probability Theory is a mathematical frame work for representing uncertain statements\n",
    "    - Provides a means of quantifying uncertainty as well as axioms for deriving new uncertainty statements\n",
    "    - Allows making uncertain statements and reasoning in the presence of uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation: \n",
    "- Machine learning must always deal with uncertain quantities and sometimes stochastic (non-deterministic) quantities resulting from:\n",
    "    - Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled\n",
    "    - Incomplete observability\n",
    "    - Incomplete modeling\n",
    "- It's usually more practical to use a *simple but uncertain rule* rather than a complex but certain one\n",
    "    - \"Most birds fly\" versus \"Birds fly, except for ...\"\n",
    "- Uncertainty can be modeled by probability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of probability\n",
    "- **Frequentist probability**\n",
    "    - Probability theory was originally developed to analyze the *frequencies of events*, which are often *repeatable*\n",
    "    - When we say that an outcome has a probability $p$ of occurring, it means that if we repeated the experiment infinitely times, then a proportion $p$ of the repetitions would result in that outcome\n",
    "    - Not seemingly applicable to propositions that are not repeatable\n",
    "- **Bayesian probability**\n",
    "    - Use probability to represent a *degree of belief* for an outcome to occur, with 1 indicating absolute certainty that the outcome occurs and 0 indicating absolute certainty that the outcome doesn't occur\n",
    "    - For properties that we expect common sense reasoning about uncertainty to have, we need to treat Bayesian probabilities as behaving exactly the same as frequentist probabilities.\n",
    "- **The extension logic to deal with uncertainty**\n",
    "    - Probability can be seen as the extension of logic to deal with uncertainty. Probability theory provides a set of formal rules for determining the likelihood of a proposition being true given the likelihood of other propositions"

    "- Given an outcome space $\\Omega$, there is some restrictions as to what subset of $2^{\\Omega}$ can be considered an event space $\\mathcal{F}$:\n",
    "    - The trivial event $\\Omega$ and the empty event $\\mathbb{0}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$\n",
    "    - The event space $\\mathcal{F}$ is closed under (countable) union\n",
    "        - if $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\mathcal{F}$, then $\\alpha\\cup\\beta\\in\\mathcal{F}$\n",
