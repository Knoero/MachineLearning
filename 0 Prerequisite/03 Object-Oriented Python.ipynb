    "# Basic Concepts\n",
    "## Definition of Class\n",
    "- At a high level of conceptualization, a class can be thought of as a category\n",
    "- For the purpose of writing code, a class is a data structure with **attributes**\n",
    "    - In python, the word **attribute** is used to describe any *property*,*variable* or *method*, that can be invoked with the dot operator on either the class or an instance constructed from a class\n",
    "- An **instance** constructed from a class will have specific values for the attributes\n",
    "- To endow instances with behaviors, a class can be provided with **methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "- A method is a function to be invoked on an instance of the class **or** the class itself\n",
    "- A method that is invoked on an instance is sometimes called an **instance method**\n",
    "- A method that is invoked directly on a class is called a **class method** or a **static method**\n",
    "- To define it formally, a **method** is a **function** that can be invoked on an object using the *object-oriented call syntax* that for python is of the form **object.method()**, where *object* may either be an instance of a class or the class itself\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Objects vs. Callables\n",
    "- Python makes an distinction between **function objects** and **callables**. While all function objects are callables, not all callables are function objects\n",
    "- A **function object** can only be created with a **def** statement\n",
    "- A **callable** is any object that can be called like a function\n",
    "    - A class name can be called directly to yield an instance of a class\n",
    "    - An instance object can also be called directly; what that yields depends on whether or not underlying class provides a definition for the **system-supplied \\_\\_call\\_\\_** method\n",
    "- In Python, '()' is an Operator - the Function Call Operator\n",
    "    - E.g. for a call **X** with method **foo**\n",
    "        - calling just **X.foo** returns the method object itself that **X.foo** stands for \n",
    "        - calling **X.foo()** cause execution of the function object associated with the method call\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-Defined Attributes\n",
    "- A class in Python comes with certain **pre-defined attributes**\n",
    "- The **pre-defined attributes**, both variables and methods, employ a special naming convention: *the names begin and end with two underscores*\n",
    "- The *pre-defined attributes* of a class are not to be confused with the **programmer-supplied attributes** such as the class and instance variables and the programmer-supplied methods\n",
    "- May think of the *pre-defined* attributes as the *external properties* of classes and instances and the *programmer-supplied* attributes as the *internal properties*\n",
    "- Commonly used pre-defined attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instance variables, Class variables\n",
    "- Attributes that take data values on a per-instance basis are frequently referred to as **instance variables**\n",
    "- Attributes that take data values on a per-class basis are called **class variables**, *static attributes* or *class attributes*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "- Hiding or controlling access to the implementation-related attributes and the methods of a class is called **encapsulation**\n",
    "- With appropriate data encapsulation, a class will present a well-defined **public interface** fro its **clients**, the uses of the class\n",
    "- A client should only access those data attributes and invoke those methods that are in the *public interface*\n",
    "- As opposed to OO in C++ and Java, all of the attributes defined for a class are **available to all** in Python\n",
    "    - A Python class and a Python instance object are so open that they can be modified after the objects are brought into existence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "- **Inheritance** in object-oriented code allows a subclass to inherit some or all of the attributes and methods of its superclass(es)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "- **Polymorphism** basically means that a given category of objects can exhibit multiple identities **at the same time**.\n",
    "- Allows us to manipulate instances belonging to the different classes of a **hierarchy** through a common interface defined for the **root class**."

    "    - Usually, any instance variables would be in the syntax **self.variable**\n",
    "- **Only one method per name in a class** regardless of the parameter structure of the function\n",
    "    - All method names are stored as keys in the namespace dictionary while the dictionary keys must be unique, so there can exist only one function object for a given method name\n",
    "    - A more general case is that a class can have **only one attribute of a given name**\n",
    "- Defining a method outside the class\n",
    "    - It is not necessary for the body of a method to be enclosed by a class\n",
    "    - A function object created outside a class can be assigned to a name inside the class.\n",
    "        - The name will acquire the function object as its binding.\n",
